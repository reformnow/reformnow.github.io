## The Beginning: When God Calls

Have you ever wondered how someone moves from not believing to belonging? The Scriptures show us that this journey begins not with human decision, but with divine initiative. The apostle Paul writes: *"And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified"* (Romans 8:30).

The call of God is not merely an external invitation shouted from afar. It is a living, effective summons that reaches the heart. When the Shepherd calls His sheep, they recognize His voice and follow (John 10:27). This call awakens something that was asleep, stirs something that was dead, and illuminates something that was blind.

## 开端：当神呼召时

你可曾想过一个人如何从怀疑走向归属？圣经向我们显明，这个旅程并非始于人的决定，而是始于神的主动。使徒保罗写道：*"预先所定下的人又召他们来；所召来的人又称他们为义；所称为义的人又叫他们得荣耀"*（罗马书8:30）。

神的呼召不仅仅是来自远方的外在邀请。它是一个活泼、有效的召唤，直达人心。当牧人呼召祂的羊时，它们认得祂的声音并跟随（约翰福音10:27）。这呼召唤醒了沉睡的，激发了已死的，照亮了瞎眼的。

## New Birth: Life from Above

Jesus told a religious teacher named Nicodemus: *"Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again... Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit"* (John 3:3, 5-6).

Just as we did not choose our physical birth, we do not engineer our spiritual rebirth. This is not a matter of human willpower or effort. The Spirit moves like the wind—we see its effects, but we cannot control its coming. A dead person cannot raise themselves; they must be given life. The helplessness of humanity in salvation is not a despair, but a doorway to grace.

</div>

## 新生：从上头来的生命

耶稣告诉一个名叫尼哥底母的宗教教师：*"我实实在在地告诉你，人若不重生，就不能见神的国... 我实实在在地告诉你，人若不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进神的国。从肉身生的就是肉身，从灵生的就是灵"*（约翰福音3:3, 5-6）。

正如我们不能选择自己的出生，我们也不能策划自己的属灵重生。这不是人的意志或努力的问题。圣灵如风而行——我们看见它的效果，但不能控制它的来临。死人不能使自己复活；他们必须被赐予生命。人在救恩中的无助不是绝望，而是通向恩典的门。

</div>

## The Response: Faith Awakened

When life is given, it inevitably breathes. So it is with faith. The apostle Paul declares: *"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast"* (Ephesians 2:8-9).

Faith is not the cause of salvation but the channel through which salvation flows. It is the open hand that receives, the eye that sees, the ear that hears. This faith is itself a gift—not manufactured by human effort, but poured into the heart by the One who calls. The proud cannot receive grace because they will not; the humble receive it because they trust not in themselves, but in Another.

</div>

## 回应：被唤醒的信心

当生命被赐予时，它 inevitably 呼吸。信心也是如此。使徒保罗宣告：*"你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸"*（以弗所书2:8-9）。

信心不是救恩的原因，而是救恩流动的渠道。它是接受的手，看见的眼，聆听的耳。这信心本身就是一个礼物——不是由人的努力制造，而是由呼召的那位 poured into 人心。骄傲的人不能接受恩典，因为他们不愿；谦卑的人接受它，因为他们不依靠自己，而依靠另一位。

</div>

## Declared Righteous: Justification

There comes a moment in the courtroom of eternity when the Judge pronounces the verdict: not guilty. Paul writes: *"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ"* (Romans 5:1).

Justification is not a process of becoming better, but a declaration of being right. The believer's sins are not merely overlooked—they are transferred to the Substitute, who bore them in full. Meanwhile, the Substitute's righteousness is transferred to the believer. It is an exchange of infinite grace: our filth for His purity, our debt for His wealth, our condemnation for His acceptance.

</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">

## 宣告为义：称义

在永恒的法庭中，有一个时刻法官宣告判决：无罪。保罗写道：*"我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和"*（罗马书5:1）。

称义不是一个变得更好的过程，而是一个被宣告为义的声明。信徒的罪不仅被忽略——它们被转移到替代者身上，祂完全承担了这些罪。同时，替代者的义被转移到信徒身上。这是一个无限恩典的交换：我们的污秽换取祂的纯洁，我们的债务换取祂的财富，我们的定罪换取祂的接纳。

</div>

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">

## The Path of Transformation: Sanctification

Having been declared righteous, the believer is now set apart for a purpose. Paul prays: *"May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ"* (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

Sanctification is the ongoing work of the Spirit, conforming the redeemed into the image of the Redeemer. It is not the ground of acceptance—that was settled at justification—but the fruit of it. The same grace that saves also sanctifies. The path is marked by struggle and progress, falls and restorations, but always moving toward holiness. It is God who works in us both to will and to act according to His good purpose (Philippians 2:13).

</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">

## 转变之路：成圣

既被宣告为义，信徒如今被分别为圣，为着一个目的。保罗祷告说：*"愿赐平安的神亲自使你们全然成圣！又愿你们的灵与魂与身子得蒙保守，在我们主耶稣基督降临的时候，完全无可指摘"*（帖撒罗尼迦前书5:23）。

成圣是圣灵 ongoing 的工作，使被救赎的与救赎主的形像一致。这不是被接纳的基础——那已经在称义时确定了——而是它的果子。同样的恩典既拯救也成圣。这道路以挣扎和进步、跌倒和恢复为标记，但总是向着圣洁移动。是神在我们心里运行，使我们立志行事都为着祂的美意（腓立比书2:13）。

</div>

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">

## The Final Hope: Glorification

The journey that began with the call of God reaches its glorious destination. Paul assures us: *"Those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified"* (Romans 8:30). Notice the past tense: *glorified*. What God has purposed, He will complete.

Glorification is not merely the absence of suffering, but the presence of perfected joy. The body—now weak, failing, and mortal—will be raised imperishable, glorious, and powerful (1 Corinthians 15:42-44). The soul—now divided between flesh and spirit—will be wholly renewed. The warfare will cease. The veil will lift. The child will see the Father face to face, and find that they were always loved with an everlasting love.

</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">

## 最终的盼望：得荣耀

始于神呼召的旅程达到其荣耀的目的地。保罗向我们保证：*"预先所定下的人又召他们来；所召来的人又称他们为义；所称为义的人又叫他们得荣耀"*（罗马书8:30）。注意过去式：*得荣耀*。神所预定的，祂必完成。

得荣耀不仅仅是苦难的缺席，而是完美喜乐的存在。身体——现在软弱、衰退、必死的——将被复活，成为不朽、荣耀、强壮的（哥林多前书15:42-44）。灵魂——现在在肉体和灵之间分裂的——将完全更新。战争将止息。面纱将揭开。孩子将面对面看见父，并发现他们一直蒙爱着，这爱是永恒的爱。

</div>

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">

## A Golden Chain of Grace

What we see in Scripture is not a random collection of spiritual experiences, but a divinely ordered progression. From the first awakening to the final glorification, God is the author and finisher of our salvation. The golden chain cannot be broken: those whom God calls, He justifies; those He justifies, He sanctifies; those He sanctifies, He glorifies.

This is the comfort of the saints—that their salvation rests not on their own fluctuating faithfulness, but on the unchanging faithfulness of God. He who began a good work will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus (Philippians 1:6). Our hope is not in our hold on Him, but in His hold on us.

</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">

## 恩典的金链

我们在圣经中看到的不是一堆随意的属灵经历，而是一个神圣 ordered 的进程。从第一次觉醒到最终的得荣耀，神是我们救恩的作者和完成者。金链不能断开：神所召的，祂称义；祂所称义的，祂成圣；祂所成圣的，祂得荣耀。

这是圣徒的安慰——他们的救恩不建立在自己 fluctuating 的忠诚上，而是建立在神不变的忠诚上。祂既然起了头，就必完成这善工，直到基督耶稣的日子（腓立比书1:6）。我们的盼望不在于我们抓住祂，而在于祂抓住我们。
