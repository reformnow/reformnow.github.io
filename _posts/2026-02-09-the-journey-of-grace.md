## Introduction: The Mystery of the Seeking God

We often speak of "finding God," as if we were the proactive searchers and He were the one lost in the shadows. We describe our journey of faith as a series of personal discoveries, intellectual breakthroughs, or emotional awakenings. However, the testimony of Holy Scripture turns this human-centric narrative upside down. The story of salvation is not the story of man's search for God, but the story of God's pursuit of man.

Before we ever took a step toward the light, the Light was already shining in our darkness. Before we ever uttered a prayer, the Father was already listening for the cry of a heart He was about to awaken. This is what we call the "Journey of Grace"—a divinely ordered sequence of events that begins in the mind of God before time began and ends in the presence of God after time ceases to be.

To understand this journey, we must recognize that salvation is not a mere "repair job" on a slightly damaged machine. It is a resurrection. It is the bringing of life where there was only death, and light where there was only void.

## 1. The Divine Source: Election and Purpose

The journey does not begin with our choice, but with God’s choice. This is perhaps the most humbling truth in all of Scripture. God did not wait for us to improve ourselves or to seek Him out. In His infinite wisdom and love, He set His affection upon His people before the world was even spoken into existence. 

This choice was not based on any foreseen merit, future faith, or hidden goodness within us. If God had waited for us to be "worthy" of His choice, the journey would never have begun. Instead, He chose us according to the good pleasure of His will, so that the glory of His grace might be displayed through our utter dependence on Him.

```bible
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. (Ephesians 1:3-4)
```

This eternal decree provides the bedrock of our security. If our salvation depended on our initial choice, it could be lost by our subsequent choices. But because it is anchored in the unchangeable purpose of God, it remains as firm as His throne.

```bible
In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will. (Ephesians 1:11)
```

## 2. The Human Condition: The Need for Grace

To appreciate the height of grace, we must first look into the depth of our own need. The Scriptures describe the natural human state not as "ailing" or "misguided," but as "dead." A dead man cannot perform CPR on himself. A dead person cannot choose to live.

This is the condition often called total depravity—not that every human is as bad as they could possibly be, but that every part of the human person (will, mind, emotions, and body) is affected by sin and is naturally inclined away from God. We were not merely walking in the wrong direction; we were incapable of seeing the right direction.

```bible
And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. (Ephesians 2:1-3)
```

Without an external, divine intervention, we would have remained in that state of spiritual death forever. The journey of grace requires a power that can reverse the very nature of death itself.

## 3. The Effectual Call: The Voice of Life

How does God bridge the gap between His eternal purpose and our temporal state of death? He does so through His call. But this is not merely a general invitation that can be ignored or rejected. While the general call of the gospel goes out to all people through preaching, there is a special, "effectual call" that God issues to His own.

When Jesus stood before the tomb of Lazarus and shouted, "Lazarus, come out!", it was not a suggestion. It was a creative command that imparted the very life it demanded. In the same way, when God calls a sinner into His kingdom, He does not just provide information; He provides transformation. He speaks, and the heart that was previously deaf begins to hear the music of the gospel.

```bible
No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. (John 6:44)
```

This "drawing" is not a dragging of a resisting soul against its will, but a changing of the will so that the soul now desires what it once despised. God makes the unwilling, willing.

```bible
But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles... (Galatians 1:15-16)
```

## 4. Regeneration: The New Birth

The inward call from God results in what Jesus described to Nicodemus as being "born again." This is the miracle of regeneration. It is the instantaneous work of the Holy Spirit where a new, spiritual life is infused into the soul. 

In regeneration, God does not just "fix" our old nature; He gives us a new one. He replaces the "heart of stone"—cold, hard, and unresponsive to divine things—with a "heart of flesh" that is soft, living, and pulsates with love for God.

```bible
And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. (Ezekiel 36:26-27)
```

This birth happens "from above." Just as we had no part in our physical birth, we are passive in our spiritual rebirth. It is the work of the Spirit, who blows where He wishes, bringing life to whom He chooses.

```bible
Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." ... "Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.' The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit." (John 3:3, 7-8)
```

## 5. Conversion: Faith and Repentance

Once the new life has been given through regeneration, the human soul responds. This response is called conversion, and it consists of two inseparable parts: faith and repentance. Conversion is the first conscious step of the believer in the journey of grace.

Repentance is a turning *from* sin—a change of mind that leads to a change of direction. It is a recognition of the ugliness of our rebellion and a sincere desire to be free from it. Faith, on the other hand, is a turning *to* Christ. It is the soul’s total reliance on the person and work of Jesus as the only hope for salvation.

Crucially, even this response is a gift of grace. We do not manufacture faith out of our own resources; it is the natural "breathing" of the new life God has placed within us.

```bible
For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9)
```

True faith is not merely intellectual assent; it is a heart-level trust that clings to the Savior. It is the realization that we have nothing to offer God but our need, and that He offers us everything in Christ.

## 6. Justification: The Great Exchange

Having been brought to faith, the believer enters into a new legal standing before God. This is the doctrine of justification. It is not a process of becoming holy (that is sanctification), but a legal declaration by God the Judge that the sinner is "not guilty" and is, in fact, "righteous" in His sight.

How can a holy God declare a sinner righteous? He does so through what theologians have called "the Great Exchange." On the cross, our sins were imputed (counted) to Christ, and He suffered the full wrath of God that we deserved. In return, the perfect righteousness of Christ is imputed (counted) to us. When God looks at the believer, He does not see our failures; He sees the perfect obedience of His Son.

```bible
For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (2 Corinthians 5:21)
```

Justification is by faith alone, apart from the works of the law. It brings an end to the "performance trap"—the exhausting attempt to earn God's favor. In Christ, the favor is already ours, fully and forever.

```bible
Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. (Romans 5:1)
```

## 7. Adoption: From Slave to Son

While justification changes our legal status from "guilty" to "righteous," adoption changes our relational status from "stranger" to "child." God does not merely pardon us and then send us on our way; He brings us into His family. He gives us the rights, privileges, and inheritance of His own children.

Adoption is the pinnacle of God's grace. It means that the Creator of the universe is now, truly and eternally, our Father. We no longer serve Him out of a spirit of fear and slavery, but out of a spirit of love and sonship.

```bible
For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, "Abba! Father!" (Romans 8:15)
```

As children of God, we are also heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ. Our future is secure because it is guaranteed by our Father’s love and the Spirit’s presence within us.

```bible
And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!" So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. (Galatians 4:6-7)
```

## 8. Sanctification: The Path of Transformation

The journey of grace does not end with our standing before God; it continues with our likeness to God. This process is called sanctification. Unlike justification, which is a once-for-all declaration, sanctification is a progressive, lifelong work of the Holy Spirit. 

In sanctification, the power of sin is gradually broken, and the image of God is restored in the believer. It is the "fruit" of our salvation. While we are passive in regeneration, we are called to be active in sanctification—yet even our activity is fueled by God's inward power. We "work out" our salvation because God is "working in" us.

```bible
Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. (Philippians 2:12-13)
```

Sanctification involves a real struggle against the remains of the old nature. It is a path of trials, discipline, and growth. But the goal is certain: we are being conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.

```bible
For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor... (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4)
```

## 9. Perseverance: Held by the Hand of God

One might wonder: after all this, could the believer yet fall away? Could the journey end in failure? If the journey depended on our strength, the answer would surely be yes. But the journey of grace is sustained by the same power that began it. This is the doctrine of the perseverance (or preservation) of the saints.

God does not merely start the work and then leave us to finish it. He protects us, disciplines us, and restores us. He who began a good work will bring it to completion. The same "golden chain" that began in eternity past reaches to eternity future without a single broken link.

```bible
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. (John 10:27-29)
```

Our security is not in our hold on God, but in His hold on us. Even when we stumble, He does not let us go.

```bible
...who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. (1 Peter 1:5)
```

## 10. Glorification: Arrival at the Celestial City

The final step in the journey of grace is glorification. This occurs when the believer enters the presence of God, either at death or at the return of Christ. It is the moment when the transformation is finally complete. The presence of sin is removed, the body is redeemed and perfected, and we see God face to face.

Glorification is the ultimate destination. All the struggles of sanctification, all the tears of this life, and all the mysteries of faith find their resolution in the beatific vision—the sight of God in His glory.

```bible
Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. (1 John 3:2)
```

In glory, the journey comes to its rest. We will no longer need faith, for we will have sight. We will no longer need hope, for we will have possession. But we will have love, and we will have grace, for we will spend eternity praising the One who brought us home.

```bible
When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. (Colossians 3:4)
```

## Conclusion: The Horizon of Grace

The journey of grace is a single, unified work of God. From the eternal "I have loved you" to the final "Welcome home," every step is a gift. There is no room for human boasting, for we have contributed nothing to our salvation but the sin that made it necessary.

As we look back on the path, we see that what we thought were our steps were often His carrying us. What we thought was our seeking was His drawing. The "Golden Chain" of Romans 8 remains the most profound summary of this journey:

```bible
And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (Romans 8:30)
```

To Him alone be the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

## 引言：寻找人的神的奥秘

我们常说“寻找神”，仿佛我们是主动的寻找者，而祂是迷失在阴影中的那一位。我们把信仰之旅描述为一系列个人发现、理智突破或情感觉醒。然而，圣经的见证却将这种以人为中心叙事彻底颠覆。救恩的故事不是人寻找神的故事，而是神寻找人的故事。

在我们迈向光明的每一步之前，那光已经照耀在我们的黑暗中。在我们发出任何祈求之前，天父已经在倾听祂即将唤醒之心的哀鸣。这就是我们所说的“恩典之旅”——一个由神预定的、始于创世之前的心思，并终结于时间尽头神同在中的神圣进程。

要理解这个旅程，我们必须认识到，救恩并非对一台轻微受损机器的“维修”。它是一场复活。它是在只有死亡的地方带来生命，在只有空虚的地方带来光明。

## 1. 神圣的源头：预定与旨意

旅程并非始于我们的选择，而是始于神的选择。这也许是圣经中最令人谦卑的真理。神并没有等待我们完善自己或主动寻找祂。在祂无穷的智慧和爱中，祂在世界被造之前就已经将爱倾注在祂的子民身上。

这个选择不是基于预见的功绩、未来的信心或是我们里面隐藏的良善。如果神等待我们变得“配得”祂的选择，那么这趟旅程永远不会开始。相反，祂按着自己意旨所喜悦的预定了我们，为要使祂荣耀的恩典，得着称赞。

```bible
愿赞美归与我们主耶稣基督的父神！他在基督里曾赐给我们天上各样属灵的福气：就如神从创立世界以前，在基督里拣选了我们，使我们在他面前成为圣洁，无有瑕疵。（以弗所书1:3-4）
```

这一永恒的旨意构成了我们安全感的基石。如果我们的救恩取决于我们最初的选择，那么它就可能因我们后来的选择而丧失。但因为它锚定在神永不改变的旨意中，它就如同祂的宝座一样稳固。

```bible
我们也在他里面得了基业；这原是那位随己意行、作万事的，照着他旨意所预定的。（以弗所书1:11）
```

## 2. 人的境况：对恩典的渴求

要体会恩典的高度，我们必须先审视自己需求的深度。圣经描述人类自然的生命状态并非仅仅是“生病”或“误入歧途”，而是“死”。一个死人无法对自己进行心肺复苏。一个死人无法选择活着。

这种状态就是灵性的死亡——这并不是说每一个人都坏到了极点，而是说人类的每一个部分（意志、头脑、情感和身体）都受到了罪的影响，且天生倾向于背离神。我们不只是走错了方向，我们根本无法看见正确的方向。

```bible
你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来。那时，你们在其中行事为人，随从今世的风俗，顺服空中掌权者的首领，就是现今在悖逆之子心中运行的邪灵。我们从前也都在他们中间，放纵肉体的私欲，随着肉体和心中所喜悦的去行，本为可怒之子，和别人一样。（以弗所书2:1-3）
```

如果没有超然的神圣干预，我们将永远留在那种灵性死亡的状态中。恩典之旅需要一种能够逆转死亡本质的力量。

## 3. 有效的呼召：生命之声

神如何弥合祂永恒的旨意与我们暂时的死亡状态之间的鸿沟？祂通过呼召来实现。但这不仅仅是一个可以被忽视或拒绝的一般性邀请。虽然福音的普遍呼召通过讲道传达给所有人，但神对属祂的人发出了一种特殊的、有效的呼召。

当耶稣站在拉撒路的坟墓前大喊“拉撒路，出来！”时，那不是一个建议。那是一个创造性的命令，赋予了它所要求的生命。同样地，当神呼召一个罪人进入祂的国度时，祂不只是提供信息，祂提供的是转化。祂说话，那原本耳聋的心就开始听到福音的旋律。

```bible
若不是差我来的父吸引人，就没有能到我这里来的；到我这里来的，在末日我要叫他复活。（约翰福音6:44）
```

这种“吸引”并不是强行拖拽一个抗拒的灵魂，而是改变其意志，使灵魂现在渴望它曾经鄙视的东西。神使不甘愿的人变得甘愿。

```bible
然而，那把我从母腹里分别出来、又施恩召我的神，既然乐意将他儿子启示在我心里，叫我把他传在外邦人中...（加拉太书1:15-16）
```

## 4. 重生：新生命

来自神的内在呼召导致了耶稣向尼哥底母描述的“重生”。这就是重生的奇迹。它是圣灵瞬间的工作，将一种全新的、属灵的生命注入灵魂。

在重生中，神不仅仅是“修复”我们的旧本性，祂给了我们一个新的。祂移走了那颗“石心”——冰冷、坚硬、对属神之事毫无反应——取而代之的是一颗“肉心”，它柔软、活泼，并跳动着对神的爱。

```bible
我也要赐给你们一个新心，将新灵放在你们里面，又从你们的肉体中除掉石心，赐给你们肉心。我必将我的灵放在你们里面，使你们顺从我的律例，谨守遵行我的典章。（以西结书36:26-27）
```

这种出生是“从上头来的”。正如我们没有参与自己的肉身出生一样，我们在属灵重生中也是被动的。这是圣灵的工作，祂随己意吹动，将生命赐予祂所拣选的人。

```bible
耶稣回答说：“我实实在在地告诉你，人若不重生，就不能见神的国。” ... “我说：‘你必须重生’，你不要以为希奇。风随着意思吹，你听见风的响声，却不晓得从哪里来，往哪里去；凡从圣灵生的，也是如此。”（约翰福音3:3, 7-8）
```

## 5. 归正：信心与悔改

一旦通过重生赐予了新生命，人类的灵魂就会做出回应。这种回应被称为归正，它由两个不可分割的部分组成：信心与悔改。归正是信徒在恩典之旅中迈出的第一个自觉步伐。

悔改是离开罪——一种思想的改变，导致方向的改变。它是认识到我们反叛的丑陋，并诚实地渴望从中获得释放。而信心则是转向基督。它是灵魂完全依赖耶稣的人格与工作，作为拯救的唯一希望。

至关重要的是，即便这种回应也是恩典的礼物。我们无法凭自己的资源制造信心；它是神放在我们里面的新生命自然的“呼吸”。

```bible
你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。（以弗所书2:8-9）
```

真正的信心不仅仅是理智上的赞同，它是心灵深处紧紧抓住救主的信靠。它让我们意识到，我们除了自己的软弱外没有什么可以献给神的，而祂在基督里为我们提供了一切。

## 6. 称义：伟大的交换

信徒有了信心，就在神面前进入了一个新的法律地位。这就是称义的教义。称义不是一个变得圣洁的过程（那是成圣），而是审判者神的一个法律宣告，宣布罪人是“无罪的”，事实上，在祂眼中是“公义的”。

圣洁的神怎能宣告罪人为义？祂是通过通常所说的“伟大的交换”来实现的。十字架上，我们的罪被算在基督身上，祂承担了我们应得的所有忿怒。作为回报，基督完美的义被算在我们身上。当神看信徒时，祂看到的不是我们的失败，而是祂儿子完美的顺服。

```bible
神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。（哥林多后书5:21）
```

称义唯独借着信心，与行律法无关。它终结了“表现陷阱”——那种想要赢得神青睐的精疲力竭的尝试。在基督里，这份青睐已经是我们的了，完全且永远。

```bible
我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和。（罗马书5:1）
```

## 7. 后嗣：从奴仆到儿子

称义改变了我们的法律身份，从“有罪”变为“公义”；而收纳为后嗣则改变了我们的关系身份，从“陌生人”变为“孩子”。神不仅仅是赦免了我们然后打发我们走，祂把我们带进了祂的家庭。祂赋予了我们作为祂子女的权利、特权和基业。

收纳为后嗣是神恩典的巅峰。这意味着宇宙的创造者现在真正且永恒地是我们的父。我们不再出于恐惧和奴化的心态服侍祂，而是出于爱和后嗣的心。

```bible
你们所受的，不是奴仆的心，仍旧害怕；所受的，乃是儿子的心，因此我们呼叫：“阿爸！父！”（罗马书8:15）
```

作为神的儿女，我们也是后嗣——是神的后嗣，与基督同作后嗣。我们的未来是稳固的，因为它由天父的爱和住在我们里面的圣灵所保证。

```bible
你们既为儿子，神就差他儿子的灵进入你们的心，呼叫：“阿爸！父！”可见，从此以后，你不是奴仆，乃是儿子了；既是儿子，就靠着神为后嗣。（加拉太书4:6-7）
```

## 8. 成圣：转化的道路

恩典之旅并未结束于我们在神面前的地位，它延续到我们与神相似的过程中。这一过程被称为成圣。与称义不同（称义是一次性的宣告），成圣是圣灵渐进的、终身的工作。

在成圣中，罪的权势逐渐被打破，神的形像在信徒里面得到恢复。它是我们救恩的“果子”。虽然我们在重生中是被动的，但在成圣中我们被要求要主动——然而，即便我们的行动也是由神内在的力量所驱动的。我们成就救恩，是因为神在我们心里运行。

```bible
这样看来，我亲爱的弟兄，你们既是常顺服的，不但我在你们那里，就是我如今不在你们那里，更是顺服的，就当恐惧战兢成就你们得救的工夫。因为你们立志行事都是神在你们心里运行，为要成就他的美意。（腓立比书2:12-13）
```

成圣涉及与旧本性残余的真实斗争。这是一条充满试炼、管教和成长的道路。但目标是确定的：我们正被模塑成耶稣基督的形像。

```bible
神的旨意就是要你们成为圣洁，远避淫行；要你们各人晓得怎样用圣洁、尊贵守着自己的身体...（帖撒罗尼迦前书4:3-4）
```

## 9. 坚忍：被神的手紧握

有人可能会问：在这一切之后，信徒仍有可能坠落吗？旅程会以失败告终吗？如果旅程取决于我们的力量，答案肯定是的。但恩典之旅是由开始它的同一大能所支撑的。这就是圣徒坚忍的教义。

神不仅仅是开启了这项工作然后留给我们去完成。祂保护我们、管教我们、恢复我们。那在你们心里动了善工的，必成就这工。罗马书8章中那条“金链”始于永恒的过去，延续到永恒的未来，没有一个环节是断裂的。

```bible
我的羊听我的声音，我也认识他们，他们也跟着我。我又赐给他们永生；他们永不灭亡，谁也不能从我手里把他们夺去。我父把羊赐给我，他比万有都大，谁也不能从我父手里把他们夺去。（约翰福音10:27-29）
```

我们的安全感不在于我们紧握神，而在于祂紧握我们。即使我们跌倒，祂也不会放手。

```bible
你们这因信蒙神能力保守的人，必能得着所预备、到末世要显现的救恩。（彼得前书1:5）
```

## 10. 得荣耀：抵达圣城

恩典之旅的最后一步是得荣耀。这发生在信徒进入神的同在时，无论是在死亡时还是在基督再临时。那是转化最终完成的时刻。罪的存在被移除，身体被救赎和完善，我们面对面地见到神。

得荣耀是救恩的终极目的地。成圣的所有挣扎、今生的所有泪水以及信心的所有奥秘，都在“荣福直观”（在荣耀中亲眼看见神）中找到了答案。

```bible
亲爱的弟兄啊，我们现在是神的儿女，将来如何，还未显明；但我们知道，主若显现，我们必要像他、因为必得见他的真体。（约翰一书3:2）
```

在荣耀中，旅程达到了安息。我们将不再需要信心，因为我们将拥有看见；我们将不再需要盼望，因为我们将拥有产业。但我们将拥有爱，拥有恩典，因为我们将用永恒来赞美那位带我们回家的主。

```bible
基督是我们的生命，他显现的时候，你们也要与他一同显现在荣耀里。（哥林多前书15:42-44）
```

## 结论：恩典的水平线

恩典之旅是神单一且统一的工作。从永恒的“我以远古的爱爱你”到最后的“欢迎回家”，每一步都是礼物。人类没有夸口的余地，因为除了制造救恩之必要的罪以外，我们对自己的救恩毫无贡献。

当我们回顾来时路，我们会发现，那些我们以为是自己迈出的步伐，往往是祂在背负着我们。我们以为是自己在寻找，其实是祂在吸引。罗马书8章的“金链”依然是对这一旅程最深刻的总结：

```bible
预先所定下的人又召他们来；所召来的人又称他们为义；所称为义的人又叫他们得荣耀。（罗马书8:30）
```

愿荣耀唯独归给祂，直到永远。阿们。
