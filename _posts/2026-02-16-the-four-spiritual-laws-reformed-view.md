### Introduction

There is probably no more widely known phrase on the love of God used today than, "God loves you and offers a wonderful plan for your life." The question is simple: is it biblical? Is that a true thing to say to all people anywhere? More significantly, how should this affect our presentation of the gospel in evangelistic crusades, settings or gospel appeals? I touch more on this in an article called Love the Lord Jesus Christ at AudienceONE. I hope you will read it as part of this discussion. God's love is undeserving; unmerited; unfailing; self-sacrificial; and unreciprocated. It is only available to sinners through the gospel of Jesus Christ.

### 简介

今天，在关于上帝的爱方面，可能没有比“上帝爱你，并为你的生命提供了一个奇妙的计划”这句话更广为人知的了。问题很简单：这符合圣经吗？对任何地方的任何人说这句话都正确吗？更重要的是，这应该如何影响我们在布道会、各种场合或福音呼召中呈现福音的方式？我在AudienceONE上的一篇名为《爱主耶稣基督》的文章中更多地谈到了这一点。我希望你能阅读它作为这次讨论的一部分。上帝的爱是我们不配得的、无功而获的、永不失败的、自我牺牲的，也是不求回报的。它只通过耶稣基督的福音向罪人提供。

### How to Rewrite the Four Spiritual Laws?

Millions of people around the world are familiar with this little witnessing booklet called, The Four Spiritual Laws. Due to my Wheaton upbringing, I even used this tract early in my Christian journey. However, upon closer scrutiny we must rightly ask, are those four spiritual laws biblical? Do they play upon our sentimental view of God that He has but one essential attribute, love, forgetting that He is also a God of justice, holiness, grace, wrath, mercy, and sovereignty? What if those "laws" were re-written from a truly biblical Reformed view--what would they look like? What would they say? Would millions use them... or shun them? Here is my attempt and offering to you. (Warning: some of the language used may sound shocking to our postmodern ears...if you are offended by any of the verbiage... it is purely intentional.)

### 如何重写属灵四定律？

全球数以百万计的人都熟悉这本名为《四个属灵的定律》的见证小册子。由于我在惠顿学院的成长背景，我甚至在我的基督徒旅程早期也使用过这本小册子。然而，经过仔细审视，我们必须正确地提问，这四个属灵的定律是否符合圣经？它们是否利用了我们对上帝的情感观点，即他只有一个基本属性——爱，而忘记了他同时也是一位公义、圣洁、恩典、忿怒、怜悯和主权的上帝？如果这些“定律”是从一个真正符合圣经的改革宗观点重写的——它们会是什么样子？它们会说什么？是会有数百万人使用它们……还是会避开它们？这是我的尝试，并呈现给你们。（警告：所使用的某些语言对我们的后现代耳朵来说可能听起来令人震惊……如果你对任何措辞感到冒犯……这纯粹是故意的。）

### 定律一

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">
God is holy, loving and just and has a plan for your life that He predetermined in eternity past according to His sovereign purpose and pleasure before anything that was made, was made. But God "hates all who practice iniquity" (Psalm 5:5) and is "angry with the wicked everyday" (Psalm 7:11). "There is none righteous, no, not one; There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one" (Romans 3:10-12). God's holy anger not only burns against the sin, but the sinner too. Who is God angry with? Who does God hate? Who are these "all" that these verses are talking about? It's you and me--everyone that's ever been born. You've heard it said, "Love the sinner; hate the sin." But both the sin and the sinner are an offense to a holy God.

上帝是圣洁、慈爱和公义的，他为你的生命制定了一个计划，这个计划是他在创世之前，根据他至高的旨意和喜悦，在永恒的过去就已经预定了的。但是，上帝“恨所有作孽的人”（诗篇 5:5），并且“天天向恶人发怒”（诗篇 7:11）。“没有义人，连一个也没有；没有明白的；没有寻求上帝的。他们都偏离了正路，一同变为无用；没有行善的，连一个也没有”（罗马书 3:10-12）。上帝圣洁的怒火不仅针对罪，也针对罪人。上帝对谁发怒？上帝恨谁？这些经文所说的“所有”人是谁？是你和我——所有出生的人。你可能听过这样的话：“爱罪人，恨罪恶。”但是，罪和罪人都是对圣洁上帝的冒犯。

As the Apostle Paul says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). How can we possibly satisfy God and be at peace with Him forever? (Isaiah 64:6; Matthew 7:12-29).
</div>
<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
正如使徒保罗所说：“所有人都犯了罪，亏缺了上帝的荣耀”（罗马书 3:23）。我们如何才能满足上帝，并永远与他和睦相处呢？（以赛亚书 64:6；马太福音 7:12-29）。

### 定律二
</div>

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">
Man is totally inable to save himself for he is totally depraved and thoroughly sinful due to Adam's original sin in disobedience to God's command in the garden; which has been imputed to all of Adam's posterity--encompassing fully the guilt and penalty of his sin. Therefore, man is incapable of pleasing and satisfying a holy God by his own good works, religious practice or ceremony; or by charitable, philanthropic acts of kindness toward God and His creatures. Man is not a sinner because he committs acts of sin; man is a sinner because by nature he is sinful, conceived in sin; and thus, before doing any deed - having any thought, motive or desire contrary to the law of God, he is guilty of the wages sin which is death. This is not because he does sinful things, but because by nature he is thoroughly sinful which can only eventually manifest acts of sin. Left in that sinful state in which he was born he will surely inherit God's wrath forever in hell. Therefore, man's righteousness is worthy only of being called "dirty filthy rags"; rendering us condemned as vessels of wrath for all eternity. God's law strips man of all confidence before a holy God and in his own ability to save himself; convicting him of sin and acting as a tutor leading men to faith in Christ. (Galatians 3:15-29; Psalm 51:5; Jeremiah 16:17; Romans 3:10-18; Romans 9:11-23; Ephesians 2:1-3; John 3:36; Romans 5:12-18).

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
人完全无法自救，因为由于亚当在伊甸园中不顺服上帝的命令而犯下的原罪，人是完全堕落和彻底罪恶的；这原罪已经归于亚当所有的后裔——完全包含了他的罪的罪咎和刑罚。因此，人无法通过自己的善行、宗教实践或仪式，或通过对上帝和他的创造物的慈善、博爱行为来取悦和满足一位圣洁的上帝。人不是因为犯了罪行而成为罪人；人是罪人，因为他天性就是罪恶的，是在罪中孕育的；因此，在有任何行为、思想、动机或愿望违背上帝的律法之前，他就已经犯了罪的工价乃是死的罪。这不是因为他做了罪恶的事，而是因为他天性是彻底罪恶的，这最终只能表现为罪的行为。如果留在他出生的罪恶状态中，他必将在地狱中永远承受上帝的忿怒。因此，人的义只配被称为“肮脏污秽的破布”；使我们被定罪为永恒忿怒的器皿。上帝的律法剥夺了人在圣洁上帝面前的一切自信和他自救的能力；使他知罪，并作为导师，引导人信靠基督。（加拉太书 3:15-29；诗篇 51:5；耶利米书 16:17；罗马书 3:10-18；罗马书 9:11-23；以弗所书 2:1-3；约翰福音 3:36；罗马书 5:12-18）。

### 定律三
</div>

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">
Christ alone is the way, the truth, the life. He lived the perfect, sinless life; He alone satisfied God and fulfilled all righteousness and the Law in His life, death and bodily resurrection so that that same righteousness, by grace through faith, can be imputed to every believer in Him so that we might have peace with God forever. And even "the faith" to believe is a grace-gift from the Lord. Christ, though being sinless, holy, and undefiled was treated on the cross as if He lived our life, so that we being sinful, unholy and completely defiled might be treated, by grace through faith, as if we lived His life. He was the perfect, sinless High Priest; and He was the perfect sinless sacrificial Lamb given. He is both Savior and sacrifice; Priest and propitiation; Lord and Lamb. (Hebrews 7:23-28; Romans 3:21-26; Romans 5:1-2; Hebrews 2::9-18. 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 John 2:1-2).
</div>
<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
唯有基督是道路、真理、生命。他活出了完美无罪的生命；唯有他满足了上帝，并在他的生、死和肉身复活中成全了一切的义和律法，以至于同样的义，借着恩典通过信心，可以归于每一个信他的人，使我们可以永远与上帝和睦。甚至相信的“信心”也是来自主的恩典礼物。基督虽然无罪、圣洁、无玷污，但在十字架上被对待，就好像他活了我们的一生，以至于我们这些有罪、不圣洁、完全被玷污的人，可以借着恩典通过信心，被对待，就好像我们活了他的一生。他是完美无罪的大祭司；他也是完美无罪的献祭羔羊。他既是救主又是祭品；既是祭司又是赎罪祭；既是主又是羔羊。（希伯来书 7:23-28；罗马书 3:21-26；罗马书 5:1-2；希伯来书 2:9-18；哥林多后书 5:21；约翰一书 2:1-2）。

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">
Repent from your sin (deny yourself), turn to Christ (take up your cross) and take the gift of the Holy Spirit (and follow Him). Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved. Submit to Him as Lord and receive Him as Savior. Knowing that it is only by Him granting to you the grace and saving faith for salvation that you can know Him and His unfailing love in your life. Rejoice in your deliverance knowing that God's love was demonstrated on the cross through Christ Jesus by dying for sinners like you and me. In place of His wrath, He now gives you grace; in place of His justice, He gives you mercy; in place of His enmity, He gives you His eternal love. What a wonderful, merciful Savior we have in Christ Jesus our Lord. (2 Corinthians 7:10; Matthew 16:24-26; John 10; Romans 10:9-10; Ephesians 2:8-9).
</div>
<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
悔改你的罪（舍己），归向基督（背起你的十字架），并领受圣灵的恩赐（并跟随他）。信靠主耶稣基督，就必得救。顺服他为主，并接受他为救主。要知道，唯有他将救恩的恩典和信心赐给你，你才能认识他，并在你的生命中认识他永不改变的爱。要因你的得救而欢喜，因为上帝的爱是通过基督耶稣为像你我这样的罪人死在十字架上而显明的。他用恩典代替了他的忿怒；他用怜悯代替了他的公义；他用永恒的爱代替了他的敌意。我们在主基督耶稣里有一位何等奇妙、慈悲的救主。（哥林多后书 7:10；马太福音 16:24-26；约翰福音 10；罗马书 10:9-10；以弗所书 2:8-9）。

### NEW LAW ONE
God is holy; and He is angry with all sinners and their sin. He has a plan for your life whether for eternal life or eternal wrath.

上帝是圣洁的；他向所有的罪人和他们的罪发怒。他为你的生命制定了一个计划，无论是永生还是永远的忿怒。

### NEW LAW TWO
There is nothing anyone can do about it. Man is sinful and utterly lost. He is totally depraved, conceived in sin, and is incapable of saving himself, pleasing God, or satisfying the Lord's righteous demands by his own merits or his own efforts of works righteousness. There is nothing we can do in our own strength, goodness, religious acts, or humanitarian gestures of kindness to please Him and earn eternal life.

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
### 新定律二
任何人都无能为力。人是罪恶的，完全失丧。他是完全堕落的，是在罪中孕育的，无法自救，无法取悦上帝，也无法通过自己的功德或自己的义行来满足主公义的要求。我们无法凭自己的力量、良善、宗教行为或人道主义的善举来取悦他并赚取永生。
</div>

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">
### NEW LAW THREE
But Christ came and died in our place and fulfilled God's law and all righteousness, took all of the sin, its guilt and penalty that would ever be committed by everyone that would ever believe; and all of the wrath of God that burns against our sin on the cross; so that by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone, on the Word alone, to the glory of God alone, we would have the hope, surety and promise of eternal life.

### 新定律三
但是基督来了，代替我们死，成全了上帝的律法和一切的义，担当了所有相信之人将要犯下的所有罪、其罪咎和刑罚；以及上帝在十字架上对我们的罪燃烧的所有忿怒；因此，唯独借着恩典，唯独通过信心，唯独在耶稣基督里，唯独依靠圣经，唯独为了上帝的荣耀，我们才有了永生的盼望、确据和应许。
</div>

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">
### NEW LAW FOUR
May God grant you saving faith and the grace to repent of your sin and receive Christ Jesus as Lord and Savior for eternal life so that you may have peace with Him forever! His love, mercy and grace no one can ever take away once your life is hid in Christ.
</div>
<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
### 新定律四
愿上帝赐给你得救的信心和恩典，使你悔改你的罪，并接受基督耶稣为主和救主，得享永生，使你可以永远与他和睦！一旦你的生命藏在基督里，他的爱、怜悯和恩典就无人能夺去。
