## I. Introduction: A Theological Crisis Hidden by Warmth

In many pulpits and evangelistic meetings today, we often hear this seemingly warm and popular analogy:

> Salvation is like a beautiful gift that has already been bought and placed on your desk. Now, God has finished His part of the work, and is just waiting for you to reach out and "sign for it."

The temptation of this logic is enormous. It perfectly caters to modern man's desire for autonomy and the psychological need to hold the initiative, making salvation look like a fair, harmonious cooperation between God and man. However, while this view seems to exalt the richness of grace, it is actually severely degrading God's sovereignty and glory. If a perfect grace's ultimate "activation" and realization completely depend on man's fallen will, then in the matter of salvation, the glory of casting the final, decisive vote will inevitably belong to man, not God. Let us look through the teachings of the Bible and early church fathers to re-examine this theological crisis hidden by warmth.

## 一、 引言：被温情掩盖的神学危机

在今天的许多讲坛和布道会上，我们常常听到这样一个看似充满温情的流行类比：

> 救恩就像是一份已经为你买好、放在你桌上的绝美礼物。现在，上帝已经做完了祂那部分的工作，只等待你伸出手来“签收”。

这种逻辑的诱惑力是巨大的。它完美地迎合了现代人渴望自主、想要手握主动权的“主体性”心理，让救恩看起来像是一场上帝与人之间公平、和谐的合作。然而，这种观点看似是在推崇恩典的丰富，实则却是在严重贬低上帝的主权与荣耀。如果一件完全的恩典，其最终的“激活”和生效居然完全取决于人堕落的意愿，那么在得救这件事上，最终投下决定性赞成票的荣耀，将不可避免地归属为人，而非神。让我们透过圣经和早期教父的教导，重新审视这场被温情掩盖的神学危机。

## II. Is the Gift for Everyone? The Two Kinds of Calling

Before discussing whether we can "accept" the gift, we must first face a sharper question: Is this gift of salvation truly distributed equally to everyone unconditionally?

Many preach that God issues a universal, identical invitation to all humanity. However, biblical theology distinguishes between two kinds of calling: the **External Call** and the **Internal Call**. 

The External Call is the preaching of the gospel message heard by human ears—it goes out to everyone indiscriminately. 

```bible
"For many are called, but few are chosen."
— Matthew 22:14
```

Yet, because all humans are totally depraved in sin, our natural response to this external call is always rejection and rebellion.

If there were only the External Call, no one would ever be saved. Therefore, for those whom God has chosen, He issues an effectual **Internal Call**. This goes beyond the eardrums directly into the dead soul, imparting new life so the sinner can willingly and joyfully believe. The "gift" is not a voucher randomly scattered to the indifferent masses, but a definite rescue personally applied by the Holy Spirit.
</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
## 二、 这份礼物是给每个人的吗？外在呼召与内在呼召

在探讨我们能否“签收”礼物之前，我们必须先面对一个更尖锐的问题：这份救恩的礼物，真的是无差别地平摊给世界上的每一个人的吗？

许多布道家宣称，上帝向全人类发出了完全相同的、普遍的邀请。然而，圣经神学中清晰地区分了两种截然不同的呼召：**外在呼召（External Call）**与**内在呼召（Internal Call）**。

“外在呼召”是人耳所听到的福音信息的传讲，它确实是向所有人发出的呼喊。

```bible
"因为被召的人多，选上的人少。"
— 马太福音 22:14
```

然而，因为全人类都完全堕落、死在罪中，我们天然的心对这种外在福音的反应，永远是借口推托、拒绝和敌视。

如果只有上帝的“外在呼召”，世界上将没有一个人会得救。因此，对于上帝所拣选的人，祂会发出一种大有能力的**“内在呼召”（或称有效恩召）**。这种呼召不只是停留在鼓膜上，而是圣灵亲自做工，直接进入人死去的灵魂中，赐下崭新的生命，使人甘心情愿地相信并顺服。因此，救恩的“礼物”绝不是向冷漠人群漫天抛洒的传单，而是圣灵亲手施放在人生命之中的精准救援。

## III. The Root Controversy: The Sinner's True Condition

### 1. From "Weakness" to "Total Depravity"

Many people misunderstand salvation because their understanding of the "destructive power of sin" is too shallow.

> Incorrect View: Fallen sinners are only "spiritually sick," "severely injured," or "in a coma." Therefore, even if extremely weak, man still retains a shred of free will and can barely reach out to catch the grace God hands him.

However, biblical truth gives a cold and real diagnosis: Man is spiritually not a patient at all, but through and through a **"dead person."**

```bible
"And you were dead in the trespasses and sins..."
— Ephesians 2:1
```

A dead person has no beating heart, no spiritual appetite, no will toward goodness, and absolutely no ability to actively "receive" life. For a person dead in the grave, even if you put the world's most precious antidote of life into his hand, he cannot grasp it. This is why **regeneration precedes faith** is an uncompromising truth. If not for God's mighty sovereignty first bestowing new life, man would never, and fundamentally could never, produce even the slightest heart of longing for God.

### 2. The Total Enslavement of the Will

We must thoroughly critique the "neutral will theory" that believes human fallenness does not affect the decision of the will. The human will is never in an impartial vacuum; it has become a slave to sin. The early church father Augustine of Hippo, when exploring the total depravity of humanity, pointed out incisively:

```quote
"For man, by the misuse of his free will, lost both himself and his free will. ... For when man, created to live uprightly, fell by his own free will, he was dragged down into the abyss of sin."
— Augustine, *Enchiridion*
```

How could a will that naturally hates and flees from God spontaneously and independently make the holy choice to "accept God"? This is impossible both logically and in spiritual fact.
</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
## 三、 根源之争：罪人的真实境遇

### 1. 从“软弱”到“全然败坏”

许多人对救恩产生误解，其根源在于对“罪的破坏力”认知过于肤浅。

> 错误认知：堕落的罪人只是在属灵上“生病了”、“重伤了”或者“昏迷了”。因此，哪怕虚弱不堪，人仍然保留了一丝残存的自由意志，能够勉强伸出手去接住上帝递过来的恩典。

然而，圣经真理给予了冰冷而真实的诊断：人在灵性上绝非病人，而是彻头彻尾的**“死人”**。

```bible
"你们死在过犯罪恶之中，祂叫你们活过来。"
— 以弗所书 2:1
```

死人没有心脏跳动，没有属灵的食欲，没有向善的意志，更没有任何能力去主动“接受”生命。一个死在坟墓里的人，哪怕你把世界上最珍贵的生命解药塞进他的手里，他也无法握住。这就是为什么，**重生先行** 是不可妥协的真理。若不是因着神大能的主权先赐下新生命，人绝不会、也根本无法产生任何一点渴慕神的心。

### 2. 意志的全然奴役

我们要彻底批判那种认为人的堕落不影响意志决断的“意志中立论”。人的意志从来不是处在一个不偏不倚的真空地带，而是成为了罪的奴仆。早期教父奥古斯丁在探讨人类彻底堕落的败坏时，曾一针见血地指出：

```quote
"人类在使用自由意志犯罪时，既失去了自己，也失去了自由意志。……因为那被造来过正直生活的人类，一旦因为自己的自由意志堕落了，就被拉到了罪恶的深渊。"
— 奥古斯丁 (Augustine, *Enchiridion*)
```

一个天然厌恶上帝、逃避上帝的意志，怎么可能自发、独立地做出“接受上帝”的圣洁选择呢？这在逻辑上和属灵事实上都是不可能的。

## IV. Logical Critique: When Faith is Misused as "Merit"

### 1. To Whom Does the "Last Step" of Salvation Belong?

Let's follow the logic of "acceptance theology": If Christ prepared the exact same salvation for all people in the world, but ultimately only Person A is saved and Person B perishes, simply because A "chose to accept."

We must raise a sharp question: In this matter, where exactly is A superior to B? Is it because A is naturally more humble? Or is he smarter and knows better how to judge the situation? If the "last step" that crosses the chasm of life and death is taken by man himself, if salvation depends on human decision, then salvation quietly morphs from complete grace into man's own proud "work."

### 2. Faith: Is it the "Cause" or the "Result" of Salvation?

Many people see faith as a condition to exchange for God's salvation, or even some kind of currency. However, the correct biblical logic is: Faith itself is a gift sovereignly bestowed by God.

```bible
"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."
— Ephesians 2:8-9
```

We need a profound theological correction: It is not because we first "believed" that God conditionally "regenerated" us; on the contrary, it is because God first "regenerated" us from the pile of dead bodies (regeneration preceding faith), removing our heart of stone, that we acquired a spiritual life capable of producing faith.
</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
## 四、 逻辑批判：当信心被误用为“功德”

### 1. 救恩的“最后一步”属于谁？

让我们顺着“接受论”的逻辑推演：如果基督为世界上所有的人都预备了一模一样的救恩，但最终只有甲得救了，而乙灭亡了，原因仅仅是因为甲“选择了接受”。

我们必须发出尖锐的质疑：在这件事上，甲比乙更优越的地方究竟在哪里？是因为甲天性更谦卑吗？还是他智商更高、更懂得审时度势？如果最终跨越生死鸿沟的“最后一步”是由人自己迈出的，如果救恩取决于人的决定，那么救恩就悄然从完全的恩典，变成了人自己引以为傲的“作品”。

### 2. 信心：是救恩的“因”还是“果”？

许多人将信心视为换取上帝救恩的条件甚至某种交换物。然而，正确的圣经逻辑是：信心（Faith）本身就是上帝主权赐下的礼物。

```bible
"你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。"
— 以弗所书 2:8-9
```

我们需要进行深刻的神学修正：我们并不是因为自己先“相信”了，上帝才以此为条件“重生”我们；恰恰相反，是因为上帝在死人堆里先“重生”了我们（重生先行），挪去了我们的石心，我们才拥有了能够生发出信心的属灵生命。

## V. Reaffirming the Truth: The Perfect Work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

Salvation is by no means an agonizing possibility-protocol thrown to humanity by God, but the perfect, indivisible redemptive work of the Triune God.

### 1. The Sovereign Election of the Father

The source of salvation is not that God "foresaw" in the long river of time that some people would have the wisdom to accept His gift (if so, salvation still relies on human cleverness), but originates from the sovereign election established by God before the foundation of the world, in His own unfathomable good pleasure.

```bible
"Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him."
— Ephesians 1:4
```

### 2. The Definite Redemption of the Son

We must constantly contrast two starkly different views of redemption: The human-centric "possibility redemption" merely believes that Christ's death built a bridge here, creating a "possibility for man to be saved," as for whether anyone actually walks on the bridge, God seems to leave it to human will. But the God-centric "definite redemption" firmly believes that Christ's shedding of blood on the cross was not blind, but to **surely purchase** the people who belong to Him.

```Bible
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
— John 10:11
```

He not only paid the price to purchase the gift on the cross, He even personally purchased the "heart to accept this gift" for all who belong to Him.

### 3. The Effectual Calling of the Holy Spirit

God's grace is absolutely not a weak, flimsy invitation that can be casually frustrated and rejected by the pride of creatures. When God sovereignly chooses to save a person, He sends the Holy Spirit to issue a call. This kind of calling is an "Effectual Calling" that reaches deep into the soul. The Holy Spirit does not merely politely knock on the door and propose; He directly changes a person's disposition, removes that hard, rebellious heart of stone, and replaces it with a soft, desiring heart of flesh, wonderfully transforming a person from a fundamental "unwillingness to believe" to a "willingness to believe."
</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
## 五、 真理重申：圣父、圣子与圣灵的完美作工

救恩绝非上帝向人类无奈抛掷出的可能性协议，而是三一真神完美的、不可分割的救赎大工。

### 1. 圣父的主权拣选

救恩的源头并非上帝在时间长河中“预见”了某些人会有智慧去接受祂的礼物（若如此，得救依旧靠着人的聪明），而是源于神在创立世界以前，在自身深不可测的美意中所定下的主权拣选。

```bible
"就如神从创立世界以前，在基督里拣选了我们，使我们在祂面前成为圣洁，无有瑕疵。"
— 以弗所书 1:4
```

### 2. 圣子的确定性救赎

我们需要不断对比两种截然不同的救赎观：人本视角的“可能性救赎”仅仅认为，基督的死在此搭建了一座桥，创造了一种人“获救的可能性”，至于桥上到底有没有人走，上帝似乎任凭人意；而神本视角的“确定性救赎”则坚信，基督在十字架上的流血并非盲目，而是为了**确实地买赎**属于祂的子民。

```Bible
"我是好牧人；好牧人为羊舍命。"
— 约翰福音 10:11
```

祂不仅在十字架上付清了买赎礼物的代价，祂甚至亲自买赎了所有属祂之人“接受这礼物的心”。

### 3. 圣灵的有效恩召

上帝的恩典绝不是柔弱无力、可以被受造物的骄傲随意挫败和拒绝的空头邀约。当上帝要主权地拯救一个人时，祂便差遣圣灵发出呼召。这种呼召是直达灵魂深处的“有效恩召”（Effectual Calling）。圣灵不仅仅是在门外礼貌地扣门提议，祂更直接改变了人的心性，除去那颗刚硬反抗的石心，换上一颗柔软渴慕的肉心，使人从根本上的“不愿信”奇妙地转变为“甘愿信”。

## VI. Pastoral Implications: To God Alone Be the Glory

### 1. The Rock of Assurance

When we understand that salvation depends entirely on God's sovereign grace, our faith has true assurance. If salvation begins with my fragile, fickle decision, then I am highly likely to lose it forever due to tomorrow's weakness or temptation; but if salvation begins with God's unshakable sovereignty before the foundation of the world, it will never fall. Perfect grace is the strongest anchor for our souls in the storm.

### 2. Radical Humility

The true gospel leaves not a shred of room for boasting or self-exaltation. We are saved not at all because we were more enlightened or sensitive than others; we can be saved merely because the mighty shepherd, in the storm, forcefully sought and carried us, a flock of sheep lost in the thorns. It was absolutely not that the dead sheep found its own way home, but that the Shepherd resurrected it and carried it home.
</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
## 六、 牧养意义：唯独上帝得荣耀

### 1. 确据的磐石

当我们明白救恩完全依赖于上帝的主权恩典时，我们的信仰才会有真正的确据。如果救恩始于我脆弱多变的决定，那么我也极有可能因为明天的软弱或是试探而永远失去它；但救恩若是始于神在创世之前不可动摇的主权，它就永不坠落。完全的恩典，是我们灵魂在风暴中最坚固的锚。

### 2. 彻底的谦卑

真正的福音不给人留下一丝一毫自夸、自视甚高的空间。我们之所以得救，完全不是因为我们比其他人更觉悟、更敏感；我们能得救，仅仅是因为那位大能的牧人，在狂风暴雨中强行寻找并扛起了我们这群迷失在荆棘里的羊。绝不是这只死去的羊自己找到了回家的路，而是牧人让它复活并抱它回了家。
</div>

<div class="lang-en" markdown="1">
## VII. Conclusion: Let God Be God

Salvation has never been an "olive branch of peace" extended by God to arrogant humanity, but the "sovereign right of redemption" exercised by the Lord of Heaven and Earth over mortal, deserving sinners. Let us stop degrading that exceedingly glorious and blood-stained redemption into a haggling transaction or a carnival of human free will.

May we bow down and worship the Lord who woke us up from the pile of dead bodies. Let God be the sole source of our salvation, and without reservation, ascribe all the glory that originally belongs only to Him, entirely back to Him.
</div>

<div class="lang-zh" markdown="1">
## 七、 结语：让上帝成为上帝

救恩从来都不是上帝向傲慢自大的人类“伸出的求和橄榄枝”，而是天地之主对必死、该死的罪人行使的“救赎主权”。让我们停止把那极其荣耀且用血染红的救赎，降格为一场讨价还价的交易或人类自由意志的狂欢。

愿我们俯伏敬拜那位从死人堆里叫醒我们的主。让上帝成为拯救我们的唯一源头，将那原本就只属于祂的荣耀，毫无保留地全部归给祂。
</div>
